  # Consider the following layout:
  # 
  #   <%= yield :header %>
  #   2
  #   <%= yield %>
  #   5
  #   <%= yield :footer %>
  #
  # And template:
  #
  #     <%= provide :header, "1" %>
  #     3
  #     4
  #     <%= provide :footer, "6" %>
  # 
  # It will stream:
  # 
  #     "1\n", "2\n", "3\n4\n", "5\n", "6\n"
  #
  # Notice that once you <%= yield %>, it will render the whole template
  # before streaming again. In the future, we can also support streaming
  # from the template and not only the layout.
  #
  # Also, notice we use +provide+ instead of +content_for+, as +provide+
  # gives the control back to the layout as soon as it is called.
  # With +content_for+, it would render all the template to find all
  # +content_for+ calls. For instance, consider this layout:
  #
  #   <%= yield :header %>
  #
  # With this template:
  #
  #   <%= content_for :header, "1" %>
  #   <%= provide :header, "2" %>
  #   <%= provide :header, "3" %>
  #
  # It will return "12\n" because +content_for+ continues rendering the
  # template but it is returns back to the layout as soon as it sees the
  # first +provide+.
  #
